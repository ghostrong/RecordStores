[Entry on Goulburn St]
Darlinghurst, 2010

Yep, well, as downloads go the way of the Dodo, CD, Tape, Mini Disc & Wax Cylinder, in the face of streaming (music as utility, you knew it was coming) turns out that Vinyl,  with its paltry 100 years of backwards compatibility, is the last man, woman and child standing.

So if, you know, you like to have a relationship with music beyond mere consumption, boy do we have goodies for you.

We've been kicking around since 2003, but all the bods who call this joint home have a combined wax experience of more than a century.

So whether you want to dig out a treasure, snag the latest 12", give in to that classic LP that's been taunting you on Spotify or just shoot the shit, listen, chat, mix or hang, you're welcome.

We open late, party later and are surrounded by the best indie retail, fashion, small bars, restaurants, clubs & cafes thst Sydney has to offer.

Located in Darlinghurst/Surry Hills on Sydney's Lower Eastside, we don't do online coz our place is too much fun.
