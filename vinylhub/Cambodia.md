### Vintage Shop - Russian Market

Russian Market
Phnom Penh
Cambodia

"‘Vintage’ is a new retro and vintage shop in the Russian Market, created by Samphors, who has a passion for the 60s-70s and three of her expatriate friends – Gino, Balazs and Archibald - who have a love of Khmer culture. The shop reflects the current interest in the ‘Sixties Khmer cultural scene, and the owners belief that this is just as relevant a part of the country’s heritage as the ubiquitous Angkorian artifacts you’ll find elsewhere in the market."
