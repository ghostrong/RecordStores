# Record Stores in Cameroon

### Music Store

Rue Congo Paraiso, Douala

Small record shop, with a collection of cd's and some vinyl. The shop-owner is also the producer of most vinyl in his shop. 

Old adress on vinyl sleeve says: 
Situe au carrefour "Anatole" Douala, Cameroon
BP 6142, 
I looked it up at maps and gave the street name of the Carrefour, it's around that sqaure on a corner, don't know the exact name of the street. So just go and look at the corner of Rue Congo Paraiso and Rue de Bell and ask around to find it.
