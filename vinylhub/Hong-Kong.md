### Classics

Room 201, Won Hing Building
74-78 Stanley Street
Central 
Hong Kong

Tricky to find, from Queen's Road walk up the road the escalator takes and take your first right down the dead-end street full of outside restaurants. There's a door on the left half way down in a white building, go through here and to the second floor.

Irregular opening hours, the owner seems to be more into it as a hobby than a business. You will find mainly classical, jazz and rock.
