# Record Stores in Iceland

### 12 tónar

Skólavörðustígur 15
101 Reykjavík
Iceland

New CDs and vinyl on two floors. First floor is dedicated to jazz and classical music, while the basement hosts a wide selection of alternative, indie and electronic.

From the official website:

The 12 Tónar shop is known as a friendly place where you can sit down, listen to a wide selection of music on two floors, enjoy free espresso or tea, read magazines and relax. We sometimes have concerts in our shop. Especially on Fridays during the summer when our lovely garden becomes the venue for all kinds of music. In 2006 the 12 Tónar shop in Reykjavik was awarded the prestigious title Shop of the Year by the City of Reykjavik.

12 Tónar is also an independent record label. Our position as a label is unique as we regularly meet with many musicians in our shop. Therefore we are in good contact with emerging talent.

### Smekkleysa

Laugavegur 35
101 Reykjavík
Iceland

Smekkleysa SM was founded in 1986 as collaborative publishing company focusing on publishing refuse of its owners.

Smekkleysa SM/Bad Taste SM, was established in Iceland in 1986, by a group of young artists and musicians, who had been active since the Icelandic punk explosion in the early eighties. Part of their world domination or death manifesto, was to create a pop band with The Sugarcubes which in turn became the backbone for Smekkleysa SMs activities over the next few years.
