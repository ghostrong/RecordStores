The employees are music experts and few of them are professional musicians whom are members at a world wide known bands.
Every few weeks an Acoustic session (usually 4-5 songs) with local known musicians take place and after it a signatures session on the musician's albums take place, the Acoustic sessions are free without any obligation to purchase at the shop.
There're also video shop and library , music instruments shop and the Ozen Bar for live shows at the Third Ear complex but I'm not familiar with them.
Even the Third Ear is a privately owned business for profits I consider it as a cultural institute.
