# Record Stores in Mongolia

### Dund Gol

next to S.M.O.K, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia
(currently changing its location, so be sure to check the FB page for soon to be new address)

Opened 2015 and changed three locations so far. 

Sells a wide range of LPs plus lots of 12". Wide selection of LPs from former USSR, Bulgaria, Romania, some Cuban and Yugoslavian records, some nice and somewhat rare Japanese LPs and 12" here and there etc. Has US, UK, German and French prints as well.

A lot of 12" from 80s and 90s, nice collection of different genres (reggae, dancehall, hip-hop, R&B, electronica, acid jazz, soul etc.) DJ friendly. Has a turntable for inspecting the records.

By far most of the LPs offered are from the former USSR, including a lot of perestroika-era rock bands. Fair prices, open for deals. Pleasant crate digging atmosphere, English spoken.

Great shop, definitely a must!
