### Loja CNM - Companhia Nacional de Música

R. Nova do Almada 62, Lisboa

The CNM Store is located in the Chiado district, in the heart of Lisbon, and is the oldest music store in the country. It is a meeting place for music lovers, musicians and intellectuals, and also a daily visit spot for tourists who seek the authenticity of Portuguese culture. Its architecture is distinguished by nineteenth-century stone structure, for the wide windows and door where natural light "invades" the space of its two floors, making it extremely pleasant and welcoming.

### Amor Records

Travessa do Marques De Sampaio, 14

Amor Records is a venture of three Brazilian crate diggers in love with music, seeking to nurture analogical feelings into digital minds. In the midst of a virtual lifestyle, as folk crave for original references, continuous contemporary growing of the “self”, and as countries raise barriers across the world, the fundamental goal is to connect the roots from all corners of the globe, while driving expectations of everything that is to come.
To build roads and bridges between places and time, that is the purpose of music. The project envisioned by a trio of passionate vinyl record addicts aims higher than a mere business enterprise. 
Fernando Martinez, Arnaldo Robles and Thiago Guiselini have touched down in Portugal to rock the core of European music culture with a rich background in deejaying, party planning and trend spreading. The choice of Lisbon as the city to raise Amor Records matches the rebirth and the growth of youth in the Iberic peninsula, projected to a global landscape of connectivity.
To bring the urban reshaping verve that disrupts Sao Paulo from the status quo, how people relate to the environment they live in, to what sound moves their bodies, whether it is rejoice or sorrow, viewpoints of surroundings, the feeling and mindset that makes one understand itself. That is the drive of this journey and endeavor. To bring a new, in-between analogical and digital, perspective into reality.
As the saying goes, “It’s not the years in your life that counts, is the life in the years”, Amor Records represents the making of new grounds for culture of the growing cosmopolite scene in Lisbon. A hub for old and new music driven creators, worldwide-specific album genre hunters. This is the place to come and deepen yourselves into exhaustively hand selected records, from all sorts of genres, themes and styles, 
From the new world, to and through the old, to all folk.

With love, ♥

Amor Records
