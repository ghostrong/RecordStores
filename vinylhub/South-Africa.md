### Steeve’s Record Shop

Jerusalem Street, Marabastad, Pretoria
South Africa

This old establishment in Pretoria’s historic kasbah or Asiatic Bazaar, as Marabastad is officially known today, is the oldest music shop in the country’s administrative capital. It opened its doors in the mid-1970s to service the musical needs of Tshwane’s jazz purists, gospel lovers and beyond. At any given time, there’s music pouring out of its shabby doors amid the din of hooting taxis.

### Deer Hunter

The shop was founded by Shaun Baskind and Kezia Eales in Joburg but relocated to Cape Town in December 2012. This migration is aptly in keeping with that of its nomadic hippie clientele.

Records are priced from R30and are famously willing to negotiate.

### Vinyl Junkie

### Jazz Avenue

Stall A08, Brightwater Commons, Republic Road, Randburg, Johannesburg
South Africa

This is Joburg’s jazz collectors’ newest excitement. It began its life as an online shop run by Etienne Shardlow. But since much of the jazz consuming crowd comprises baby boomers who still find the internet daunting, the shop had to find a physical home. It stocks all manner of jazz from across the world including CDs, DVDs and a focused selection of collectible vinyl.

### Multi-Racial Records

Duncan Yard Centre, 1204 Prospect Street, Hatfield, Tshwane
South Africa

This started as an events company in 1999 and turned into a record store in 2003. It is the brainchild of DJ Sisco Ribeiro and his friend Art Jones, who passed away in 2009. Out of their shared passion for House music, it grew into a favourite spot for House vinyl collectors. The shop is also home to a record label of the same name, which famously championed a first-on-vinyl release strategy at a time when CDs had taken over the industry. They now boast a DJ school.
