### White Wabbit Records

1F., No.1-1, Ln. 21, Pucheng St., Da’an Dist., Taipei City 106, Taiwan

The coolest independent record store/label in Taiwan. Established in 2002, White Wabbit Records is one of the leading indie labels and also the pioneer tointroduce international indie music to the young professional generation in both Taiwan and Hong Kong. Not only import indie albums, we also develop the licenses from foreign companies. In addition, we also organize concerts which invites prestigious rock bands to perform to local loyal fans.

### Beans & Beats

No. 346, Fujin St, Songshan District, Taipei City, 105

Like all good hip hop record labels, KAO!INC knows how to be enterprising. Enter Beans & Beats, the hip hop offering on Fujin Street that puts fat meats next to phat beats – the kind of place that Action Bronson might be proud of. The brainchild of self-proclaimed Kaohsiung ‘hoodboy’ Dela-Fat, KAO!INC is a typical ‘Started From The Bottom’ rags-to-rap-riches kind of story, growing from a mere hip hop-listening crew to an important backer of Taiwan’s underground hip hop scene. Its relatively new dining venture provides a juicy selection of burgers and local brews, as well as hip hop classics on wax (think Straight Outta Compton and Illmatic). A winning combination of eating big and listening to Big.

### Xiao Sung Records

### Reused (再造_藝文聲響實驗室)

No. 156, Wenlin N Rd, Beitou District, Taipei City, 112

Reused takes pride in the recycled. Before you accuse us of pointing out the obvious, it’s worth mentioning that Reused incorporates this concept into every facet of its multi-functional studio. Housed on the 2nd and 3rd floor of an old building all the way up North in Beitou, Reused not only converted the derelict space into a hidden but thriving artists’ hangout, but an emporium of all things old and vintage. Included in its extensive collection of vintage finds (posters, toys, furniture) is, of course, rare vinyl. With alternative hip hop picks (Madlib, anyone?) and soundtracks from the likes of Star Wars, Reused offers a small but thoroughly gratifying crate-digging experience. For nostalgia seekers staying out late into the night, the space doubles as a hostel and bar.

### Syntrend Vinyl (三創黑膠)

No. 2, Section 3, Civic Blvd, Zhongshan District, Taipei City, 104

Boasting of more than 20,000 records in its combined sales floor and warehouse spaces, this waxy hotspot, housed inside the newly-established Syntrend Creative Park, is a connoisseurs’ paradise. As one of Taipei’s biggest record collections, Syntrend Vinyl puts an emphasis on classical classics – though old jazz and pop favorites are not entirely dismissed either. More fascinating than the sheer volume of records is the curios on display: limited edition sonatas on wax locked firmly behind glass cabinets, some of which valued at more than NT$80,000, will easily break collectors’ hearts or bank accounts. True audiophiles may rejoice; Syntrend Vinyl is aptly situated near major audio gadget go-tos like Harman/Kardon, so you can pick up all the essentials in one quick go.
