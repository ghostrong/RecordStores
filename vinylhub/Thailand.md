### 1979 Vinyls and Unknown Pleasures

4/F, Black Amber (inside the soi at the corner of Kiatnakin Bank, between sois 5 and 7), Sukhumvit Soi 55 (Thonglor) 
Bangkok, Thailand

This vinyl store, run by a group of college friends who draw inspiration from early-2000s Brit-rock, is situated in the busy Black Amber building (home to the barbershop of the same name and craft studio Smitheries). The store has been anointed by Put Suksriwan, former owner of Harmonica, as one of the best new places to catch small local indie gigs—and small is the operative word. About 40 brave souls can cram into the tiny space, making it an ideal stomping ground for upcoming solo artists or bands with minimalist set-ups.
