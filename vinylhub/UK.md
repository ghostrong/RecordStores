### Death Or Glory Records

3 Church Green East Redditch, B97 4DY Redditch

Like all music lovers we respect the hard work musicians put into their records. The hours in a studio, the artwork, the album title, and the blood sweat and tears that go into it. So own it, hold it, smell it, play it and love every bloody second of it as you watch it on the turn table. Most importantly buy it from your local independent record shop.
When the idea of Death or Glory Records first came about it was with you in mind. We wanted to be different from the rest and do what is close to our hearts: help and support people. We aim to do this in many ways; some will be apparent from looking around the shop, others are more subtle but are just as important. In the shop we display work from both local music photographers, showcasing their immense talent for all to see and we also have a gallery of artwork from students from NEW College, which is a partnership we are very proud of. We are very passionate about supporting local talent whether that be photography, art or music.
Death or Glory Records also believes everyone deserves a chance. It is with this in mind that we work to support young people with employment opportunities. We work closely with the Job Centre to give employment and work experience to young people who are not getting that chance elsewhere, those who desperately want to work but aren’t getting the chance, for people who are keen to learn new skills and develop.
As a Community Interest Company, any profits that the shop makes does not go to the directors or management; they go back into the community. Profits are used to help young unemployed people, to help local photographers and artists and to help local bands. We are very proud of the bands and musicians that have and are currently associated with Redditch and the region. We want to encourage and nurture the next generation. This will take many forms, from helping provide equipment, putting on gigs and releasing Singles, EP’s and Albums through our label.
So now it is over to you. Please support us, share your ideas and get involved.

### Fives Records

103 Broadway, Leigh-on-Sea SS9 1PG

We are a family business which was opened by Peter Driscoll in 1977 at 55 Elm Road - hence the reason it was called Fives. We had to move to new  premises on the Broadway about 18 months later because it took off and we desperately needed more space.  Soon after, a second branch was set up in Rayleigh which Sandra (Peter's daughter), fresh out of school, was running. It thrived for 25 years  before closing in September 2006 with the owner Peter going into semi-retirement.

In October 2007 we celebrated our 30th year and Mcfly popped in for a special CD signing session, before heading to the Cliffs Pavilion,  Westcliff, for their much anticipated concert.

We used to have a lot of bands come in and do signings. We've had Billy Bragg, Donny Osmond and Snowy White down here and more recently the  Horrors and even a mini concert by the Rumble Strips in front of the counter.

Recently Wilko Johnson the legendary guitarist of the band Dr Feelgood dropped in to do an in store signing and meet the fans on the release day of his new album `going back home' on 24-3-2014

On Record Store Day we have many artists performing throughout the day from the local area as well as DJs playing music to make it a fun and entertaining day for all vinyl enthusiasts. 

With 50,000+ titles on CD and vinyl packed into the shelves and even more in our retail storage which is slowly being put up for sale on our Amazon and Discogs stores, there's not much the shop doesn't have and if we don't have it and if it is still  available we will order it for you, most ordered items can be got within a week or so.

You can phone and speak to a real person about any particular item that you are interested in. Customer service is something we are well known for, we have access to many large databases and can find quite obscure items or fill in the webmail form on our contact page and we will get an answer to you in very short time.

All major credit cards are accepted and we are happy to post to almost anywhere in the world.

All of our products are new,unplayed and in mint condition unless otherwise stated.We are constantly adding new titles  from our extensive storage and covering all genres and decades. Please note that we do not buy or sell second hand  vinyl or CD`s all our stock comes direct from the manufacturers.

We are also members of the Entertainment Retailers Association (ERA).  

All our customers can be assured of the highest levels of customer service. Visit our Amazon of Discogs stores for many rare and deleted items on Vinyl and CD

We are normally open for 11am to 5pm on Tuesday to Saturday.

In September 2017 we made the move to new bigger premises at Unit 7 Hollyhill Park. We have now been trading for over 3 years.

Based in Edinburgh's Stockbridge, we try to uphold it's tradition of quirky independent shops. We are proud to be one of the newest record stores in the world. Our newest additions include vinyl releases by Scottish artists on local independent labels. Our stock caters to most tastes and all budgets. The shop is owned and run by George and Darren. Two record collectors who came together with their record collections and some good fortune.

We pride ourselves on the quality of our vinyl. The front shop has a wide selection of LPs, the majority being in Excellent condition or better. You are not likely to need to upgrade any of your valuable records if you buy them from us. Our sections include British and American Blues, Jazz, Rock, Folk/Folk-Rock, Reggae, Punk, New Wave and Indie. We have most collectible genres other than techno. We also have some new and used CDs and a selection of collectible 78rpm discs and 45rpm singles.

Our back room is a treasure trove of bargain records. Around 1000 LPs and 1500 singles, all priced at a wallet friendly £1.50. There is a small selection of Classical LPs/Box Sets, 12" singles and music books, and sometimes some memorabilia. Our rubbish filters are set high so you will not be looking through lots of pipe bands and easy listening to find some great music in The Backroom. We keep a vintage 1960s Dansette record player with lovely tone which you can try any records on before you buy.

Spinning Discs Sheffield is an independent record store established to give music lovers in Sheffield a place to meet, relax, drink coffee and browse new, reissue and select second hand vinyl in a friendly community environment. We are not a global. We value our Customers, their views and their comments.

We cater across the very wide board of musical tastes from Indie to Classical and Hip Hop to Metal.

If we don’t happen to cater for a Customer’s taste then we always welcome a discussion to see what we can do.

We want you to enjoy the experience of spending time browsing through physical records and perhaps chancing upon something you fancy or even just liking the cover art and thinking “why not”.  We believe that the age of the physical format is here to stay.  So let’s get physical.

If you love vinyl and love music then Spinning Discs Sheffield is definitely worth a visit.

From September 2016 we've opened the Record Emporium in the back of Spinning Discs Sheffield with over 1,500 select second hand titles to dig through!

Operating from modest premises in a former Mexican restaurant, we’ve tried our best to provide the kind of record shop that we would like to visit on our travels.

### Track Records

3, Hill Street
Ballymena
Co. Antrim
Northern Ireland
U.K.
BT43 6BH

A small second hand vinyl store, with a penchant for selling the odd cd, cassette tape, book, poster or anything else we think we can turn around.

Based in Northern Ireland we stock well graded and reasonably priced vinyl. Due to our location we would specialise in Irish music and Country. Due to our own personal music taste we also stock a great brand of soul, northern soul, funk and disco. 

Remember. This is a town who once stopped ELO playing here because the were said to bring the 4 D's (Drink, Drugs, Debauchery and the devil)

So we effectively run a record shop in the same town were Kevin Bacon lived in Footloose. Surely that's worth supporting

Save Records started in Rochdale, way back in 1968, but has been on Bury Indoor Market since the mid 1970's. Over the years, the role of the record shop has changed, with many being forced to close as the way people buy music changed. We are now the last independent record shop in Bury and sell from our large back catalogue of albums and singles on CD & vinyl. We even have tapes! Well, if vinyl can make a comeback, why not the humble but resilient cassette? 
 
We cater for a wide range of musical tastes, from the 1950s to date: pop, punk, easy listening, metal, classical, jazz...it's all here. We also sell a wide range of DVDs, covering both music and movies.Our CD albums have various prices, but many are just £5.99, so why not pop in and see what you can find? If you are looking for something in particular, just let us know and the chances are we can get it for you.

We've fitted some new racking for LPs and 12"s, so now there's even more than there was before! Come and have a look!

### Eastern Bloc Records

5A Stevenson Square,
Northern Quarter,
Manchester,
M1 1DN
England
United Kingdom

Eastern Bloc was established in 1985 by John Berry & Martin Price (from band 808 State). The shop was originally located in Afflecks Palace and since 2011 moved to its present location on Stevenson Square (5a Stevenson Sq, Northern Quarter, Manchester). 

It soon became a cultural icon and integral part within the Manchester music scene. Back in the late 1980’s, the shop helped to launch bands such as the Inspiral Carpets, while also hosting in-store signings with The Stone Roses and Happy Mondays. The shop was also responsible for breaking much of the new dance music at the time, being one of the only shops in the UK to import dance music from around the globe. One of the owners went on to become part of 808 State. 

E Bloc also had heavy involvement in the early career paths of A Guy Called Gerald, and K-Klass. Many famous faces have worked behind the counter or been regular customers in the shop. Local DJ’s and globe trotting club DJ’s would often use the shop as their first port of call to get their hands on the latest vinyl promos. 

Customers have included Laurent Garnier, Jon Da Silva, Mike Pickering, Graeme Park, Sasha, Chemical Brothers, DJ Marky, Anthony Shake Shakir, Pepe Bradock, Eric Morillo, Josh Wink, Ben Sims, James Holroyd, Derrick Carter, Carl Cox, Synkro, Indigo, AnD, XXXY, Jon K, Rich Reason, and many more. Previous members of staff include Justin Robertson, Marcus Intalex, Mark XTC, Moonboots, Dean Wilson, Paul Walker, Paul Taylor, Karl Roscoe, Chris Fatboy.

E Bloc has always been at the cutting edge of the music scene as is arguably one of the most respected, renowned, influential and notorious in the world. Today, the store is still shifting vinyl and CD’s, specialising mainly in drum'n'bass, jungle, dubstep, house, techno, and electronica.

We are an independent family business with a real passion for music, spanning over 40 years.

After starting out as mobile and club DJs, and managing a national record outlet in our teens/early twenties, we're continuing to  do what we love - helping to keep vinyl music alive by buying and selling preloved records, associated memorabilia, books and record players; searching for requested singles and albums; sharing our diverse musical tastes with our customers & friends (and vice versa); and delivering professional DJ and Compere services for private parties, corporate and public events. All centred on the 1950s through to the early 1990s.

We even hand craft practical items and gifts using scratched records and album covers! Bespoke orders welcome.

Come and say hello and browse our stock of preloved vinyl records, cassette tapes, music books and memorabilia, etc.
 
We have two rooms: one filled with LPs, tapes and CDs, the other with 7" and 12" singles. And we've set up a listening point so you can try before you buy!

### Jacaranda Records Ltd

21-23 Slater Street, Liverpool, United Kingdom

Situated on the first floor of the legendary Jacaranda Club, where the Beatles originally performed in the 1950s.

THE JACARANDA CLUB
The Jacaranda's history dates back to the 1950s, when local businessman and promoter Allan Williams opened the venue as a coffee bar. The Italian espresso machine was a stylish, exciting innovation in post-war Britain. Coupled with a jukebox and live music performances, it gave coffee bars a cool and colourful atmosphere that was popular with teenagers.
Unlike conventional youth clubs, often associated with schools or churches, coffee bars were free of authority figures. Teens could make a coffee bar their own, providing them with an environment to hear modern, American-influenced music, and to socialise without the watchful eyes of parents or schoolteachers.
The Beatles were frequent customers, with John Lennon and Stuart Sutcliffe attending the nearby Liverpool Art College and Paul McCartney studying at the adjacent Liverpool Institute. After asking Williams for a chance to perform at The Jacaranda, Williams instead put them to work redecorating (their painted murals, now restored, still adorn the basement bar). As a part of the deal, John and Paul were able to use the basement as a rehearsal studio during the day to fine tune their craft and were rewarded when Allan asked to become their manager. Helping to hone their world beating act, Allan took The Beatles on their first tour of Hamburg in 1961. Towards the latter end of the year, Williams and the Beatles got into dispute over pay from their Hamburg tours and soon parted ways. 1962 was the year the Beatles signed with Brian Epstein who took them onto international stardom and the household name we now recognise.
The Jacaranda itself has lived through various incarnations and has seen many changes since the 1950s. After a mysterious closure in 2011 amidst a changing Liverpool nightlife landscape, many wondered if there was a future for the iconic club. A surprise re-opening in late 2014- as well as the opening of a new record store and coffee shop in 2015- reasserted The Jacaranda's position as one of the city's finest and most interesting venues.
The club consists of three floors- basement, ground floor, and first floor, each with its own unique purpose. The basement functions as a late-night club and music performance space, hosting the grass-roots of Liverpool's music community; the ground floor remains as a traditional bar, serving a wide selection of cocktails, bottled beers, and draught to a jukebox soundtrack; and the first floor contains a record store and coffee shop.
The owners and staff that make up the Jacaranda's extended family are deeply passionate about music. This drives our dedication to providing music to the people of Liverpool. A devotion that began with the freewheeling ideals of post-war Liverpudlians and culminated in The Fab Four still lives on inside the cosy confines of our Slater Street home -a place to revel in the beauty of classic music and discover new and exciting sounds.

Edinburgh,

EH1 1BP

Music specialist & audio emporium with 1000s of vinyl records, CDs, and audio products, plus a comprehensive selection of sound equipment and DJ technology.

The sole surviving independent Dance, Electronic, and specialist record shop in Edinburgh, selling quality music and audio equipment in Scotland’s capital since 1995.

Starting in a dingy Old Town basement on Cockburn Street before relocating to overground premises further down the same street, they began as an ‘underground’ record shop selling House, Techno, Disco, Hip Hop, Funk, Soul, Jazz, and Drum & Bass on their preferred vinyl medium. To this day they still support the format which kicked it all off, stocking hundreds of new releases every week, though embracing any new technology which makes the enjoyment of music possible. They've also expanded the range of music they sell, to incorporate Classic Rock, Pop and current indie releases.

You’ll find their shelves groaning with the latest DJ and music production equipment including turntables, mixers, CD decks, midi controllers, computer DJ systems, software, speakers, and headphones from all the top brands such as Pioneer, Novation, Allen & Heath, Focusrite, Rane, Native Instruments, Korg, Akai, Reloop, Sennheiser, Stanton, Numark, M-Audio, Ortofon and Pro-ject.

There are stacks of wax to wade into, and countless CDs to get your ears around, but also a wide range of accessories including cartridges & stylus, vinyl/equipment cases/bags, T-shirts, and numerous books and magazines.
