### The True Vine Record Shop

3544 Hickory Ave
Baltimore, MD 21211

True Vine features an eclectic mix of music from rock, alternative, pop, indie, psychedelic, hip-hop, and jazz genres. We searched through French, African, Turkish, German and Korean musical libraries, works of outstanding musical composers, records that go all the way back in the 1920s during the golden age of music, pioneers of pop rock, albums that use homemade instruments and not your usual technical instruments, albums recorded inside their homes, and rare musical compilations to give you the best collection of nontraditional music albums. The True Vine Shop veers away from mainstream music to give the much-deserved spotlight to other artists who made an impact in their respective lands’ music industry. We have hard to find, off the record shops albums for the weirdos, freaks, and music junkies out there. Our selections are admittedly eclectic and eccentric for the usual taste but we are not mainstream anyway.

If music is your muse you won’t be disappointed when you visit our record shop, which has been described by City Pages as “the best pop culture museum in the state” and by Rolling Stone as “a classic, overstuffed mom-and-pop used-vinyl haven.” There’s plenty of room and places to sit, and the records are categorized for comfortable digging. Even our stock of thousands of 45s are easy to thumb through – where else are you going to find that?

We have three listening stations where you can play any record in the shop and a reasonable return policy if you’re disappointed by your finds, so there’s no worries. After all, it’s supposed to be fun!

For us, a good day isn’t measured by how much money we make in sales, its in the number of regulars we see and the number of new customers who visit and say, “Wow, what a great shop you have here!”
- Laura and Dave Hoenack

Dan Curland opened the Disc in 1983, with twenty  feet of bins, 500 records, and a register  donated by a vegetarian  restaurant. During the days before the CD changed the way we listen to music, the Disc began to create  an atmosphere  in Mystic that would  lead to a music and art renaissance. The tiny store was stuffed with vinyl records, serious collectors, kids looking for new sounds, local musicians  of all flavors , and curious onlookers.  Even as the CD became the prevailing format, LP records remained .  In a world slowly  losing  sight of tradition,  the Disc became and remained a pillar. The small burg now had an epicenter, around which began to orbit  an interesting  music  scene,  a flourishing gallery  element,  and small publishers  creating  chapbooks and journals.  Much of this period  is captured on “Trapezium”, a CD compilation put  together  in 1996 by Curland and the Disc featuring  music, photography, and design from Mystic.

“Our local customer base has made us what we are, and that  is why  it’s so important  to have  a symbiotic relationship  with them, and the region in general”  Curland states  about his involvement  in the local  culture.  In addition to the shop, Curland has also been a DJ on WCNI 90.9 FM radio for over twenty years. This nurturing element has been  a mainstay for the business, as electronic  connections  have  enabled generations of Mystic music lovers  who continue to shop at the Disc to this day. “We have  regular  customers who call or email us about records they are looking  for from places  as diverse  as Cape Cod  to Willimantic, CT.  From places as far away as Hawaii  and  Amsterdam.  From ferry riders crossing Long Island Sound, to vinyl tourists  from cities  such as New York, Baltimore, and Boston. Mystic Disc customers  are everywhere, and more are joining the ranks each  week.

As downloading and file sharing became   more  prevalent, record store seekers continue to find the Mystic Disc. Boasting  over  fifty feet of vinyl record bins in their 300 square foot store, the Disc caters to most every  taste in music.  In addition to the standards, they also carry an extensive  section of esoteric vinyl for the DJ or producer. Spoken word, soundtracks, DJ resources,  compilations   from several time periods,  and world  music  all find a place to call home. If you are a music lover, so should you find a home  at the Mystic Disc.

### Johnny's Records

45 Tokeneke Rd, Darien, CT 06820

Johnny's has been in business since 1975. Originally begun by the owner John Konrad as a way to channel his overactive libido, Johnny's rapidly became famous and infamous from coast to coast as a place where music, imagination and life meet in a psychedelic blend of pranksterism and outlaw humor. Former employee Moby once said, "Johnny's is the kind of place where I could lose my mind if I could only remember where I left it." Ronnie James Dio told Johnny his jewelry was groovy. Two of the four original members of Kiss chaporoned their ladies down Johnny's aisle. The late Gilda Radner contemplated buying a pair of vans sneakers but settled on a floppy hat. Mystics and rabble rousers are constantly seeking out Johnny. It's not just that he knows the history...he's glad to share it with you.

### Red Pets Records

303 Division St S
Northfield, MN 55057

Now-closed store. From the owner/founder:
"I started Red Pets Records in Northfield, Minnesota, in 1991 to bring the plethora of interesting independent music to this college community. A year in, I reorganized as a consumer cooperative, bringing in ultimately over 100 members who received discounted prices and worked in the store to increase their discount. I like to say I thought of it as a retail operation with the soul of a nonprofit arts organization. I moved the store out of its storefront in 1996 and onto the Web, finally suspending sales operations in 1998."

Breakbeat Science Recordings was a drum and bass record label and record store of the same name based in Manhattan in New York City, New York; both the label and the store were founded in 1996, and a website was launched in 1997. Breakbeat Science was the first store dedicated to Drum and Bass music in the US, at the time of its opening the scene was still primarily based in the UK.

Breakbeat Science moved several times over the years. The first location was on 9th Street and the store later moved to Orchard Street, both in Manhattan's East Village. After the Orchard Street location closed, the remaining backstock was moved to the Halcyon record shop in Dumbo, Brooklyn.

### Music Matters

527 Cayuga Drive, Niagara Falls, NY 14304

Really low key record shop, guy who runs it is really chill and the entire store generally specializes in vinyl of rock and roll and metal of the 50s to the 90s, a bit of 2000s and 2010s albums scattered in the store but overall a very nice selection and very impressionable staff, makes you feel at home. Large selection of vinyl ranging from usual Beatles', Iron Maiden, Nirvana, Rush, Pink Floyd to other stuff such as David Bowie, Green Day, and Badfinger. Most records are used but kept in great condition, as he won't sell you beat up stuff and he has started selling more new vinyl. There is also a large amount of cd's as well as video games and dvd's so it's a one-stop shop for a lot of media. Cd's and dvd's are towards the front and the vinyl and video games are in the back of the store. Overall great selection and Rob (the owner) is a super nice guy and cares about the music. Highly suggest visiting this shop as the prices aren't going to break your bank, some titles are more expensive but overall you can find most vinyl there for around 15 or lower.

### Papa Jazz Record Shoppe

From their Website:

Welcome to Papa Jazz Record Shoppe's online home. As one of the largest (and, if we do say so, best) record shops in the southeast United States, we've cemented a 33-year reputation for having the rarest, coolest stuff around. And, to boot, we've got some of the best prices too.
Whatever you're looking for, we've probably got it, so please email us at info@papajazz.com and we'll see if we can help you find that piece of music you've been looking for

And though jazz is certainly our specialty (particularly free jazz and avant garde), we're also quite a source for rare funk/R&B, hip-hop, punk/indie rock, progressive rock, classic rock, reggae and pretty much anything you might be looking for. And whether it's on LP, CD, 45, or now DVD we just might have it. We take care of our stock as well - read about how we clean & grade our records.

We hope you'll send us your want list, and heed the words of Fred D. Cat: "If Papa Jazz ain't got it, it ain't worth having."

### Audio Archaeology

1324 W Devon Ave

Records represent more than just a superior sound; they’re a little bit of nostalgia – in the richness of the music, the style of the album design, even the smell of the vinyl. It's the tangible feel as you stack albums on a changer, and pause to flip to the B-side.
 
   As a child, I combed thrift shops for 78 records, and took tube radios apart so see how they worked. Audio Archaeology is the culmination of a lifetime of collecting, decorating and tinkering.
 
   If you have an idea for a unique system, or if you’re looking for something classic, we can help. From Mid-Century Modern consoles or Bakelite Portable Record Players to Contemporarily-styled Systems and Component Turntables, we have something for every purpose. We offer a full line of Crosley record players, for a new take on classic styles.
 
   But there’s more to a ‘vinyl lifestyle’ than just music! Check out our home accessories and gifts, sure to compliment a modern, classic style. We are a record store, an audio store, a vintage store, a record player store and much more!

Welcome to Enterprise Records, an LP-only retail store operating in Portland, Maine.

If you find yourself in northern New England, be sure to pay us a visit. You’ll be glad you did. In addition to our large and thoughtfully selected rock section, we have selections in categories like jazz and reggae (with separate dub ska sub-sections) that are wide and deep enough to look good in any city you could name. Also rockabilly, blues, soundtracks, spoken word... and hard-to-find stuff going into stock every day. And we’re really fussy about condition, all of our stuff is clean, clean, clean.

We are always buying records! If you're not listening to them, sell them!

Excellent selection of vinyl's, both new and used. The new section contains plenty of current artists, as well as new re-issues of classic albums. The used section is well stocked, and the owner has rated the condition of each record so you know what you are getting. Used prices are very reasonable. New prices are similar to what you would find online. If the record you are looking for is not in stock, the owner will order it for you. There is also a decent selection of "bargain bin" records that start at 25 cents. The selection is mainly focused on rock and roll, but you can find something from almost any genre. If you are looking for classic rock and roll albums, this is the place to go. Highly recommended. The store also carries CD's and videos but the real focus here is on vinyl. Closed Sundays and Mondays.

### The Record Exchange

256 Washington St
Salem, MA 01970

The Record Exchange is one of the oldest used brick & mortar record stores in the United States, founded in Salem, MA in 1974. 2014 marks their 40th Anniversary. They specialize in buying & selling used & new records, as well as CDs & DVDs. They don't have a website.

From their Facebook page:
Each record we price & display for sale is carefully cleaned, graded/evaluated and processed. LPs (and 45s) are priced according to CONDITION of vinyl, CONDITION of cover, and PRESSING (original 1st pressing, vintage 2nd or later pressing, current reissue, etc.) We are strict in our grading, and strive to be as transparent & honest as we possibly can be in our selling, labeling our records with descriptions & significant details. Only 2 of us price records, so there is a noticeable consistency in our pricing as well. (SEE FAQ BELOW). Finally, each cleaned & priced LP (over $3.99) is bagged with a 2 mil protective sleeve, and most pricier LPs are DOUBLE-SLEEVED for protection. Should you read "as is" or "marks" on a sticker, expect there to be some slight/light to moderate marks, or signs of play/use, and that there will most likely be some varying degree of occasional superficial background noise, occasional slight-light ticks/pops and the like. We do NOT sell LPs with deep, feelable scratches or that are destroyed (really beat up)! As noted, these LPs are priced accordingly and offer to our customers better value for their dollar. It also explains why customers may sometimes note widely varying prices on what looks to be the same record. A VG- Led Zeppelin LP should be much less than a near MINT 1st pressing original.

### Bananas Music

2887 22nd Ave N, St Petersburg, FL 33713

Bananas Music is owned by Doug and Michelle Allen.  You've heard the story before.  The couple who had full time jobs working for other corporations.  Doug was in environmental work and Michelle was a registered Nurse. We had a dream of our own business so we started a book store in 1977. As avid readers this was perfect for us.  Then one day, at a garage sale, Michelle wanted a record and the Lady would only sell the whole stack, so  Michelle took the one record out and put the rest on a shelf in the store and every single record sold.  So more records were purchased and soon the records over took the books and the book inventory was sold. 

Over the years we continued to add vinyl of all types,  even though the Compact Disc had come to be and of course we continue to purchase vinyl to this day.  We are very hands on owners, so if you come visit, we will more than likely be there to greet you.  

Doug is a recognized record appraiser and does appraising for private individuals and insurance companies.

We have collectively over 17,000 sq. feet of space in two stores. Our all vinyl warehouse which is 6500 sq feet. and our retail store on 22nd Ave N. which is over 11,000 sq. feet.   Our two story warehouse is where our vast amount of nearly 3 million Lps and 45's are stored.  Our retail store has  compact disc , movies and more records for sale.  We also offer discount records at this location.  We get 1,000's of records in each week, so if you don't see something on our web page, please email us or keep looking for additions to our online site.

### Ragged Records

418 E 2nd St
Davenport, Iowa 52801

Welcome to the Ragged Records Homepage!

I started Ragged Records after a 4 year hiatus from the music business. In the summer of 2008, I decided the time was right to jump back in - only this time with just used and collectible music and related items.

I have worked in music retail for over 20 years (and owned 3 CO-OP Records in Central Illinois), plus sold at numerous record conventions since the early 1980's. With an inventory surpassing a quarter of a million pieces, I feel the shop can fulfill the music wants of rare, hard to find, or out of print items.

The shop has become a favorite haunt for touring bands, with its close proximity to I-80, coming in to to browse our stock of LPs, 45s, CDs & DVDs - ALL USED - plus music paraphernalia (including promo & vintage concert posters). Check us out - you never know what you'll find or who you'll see!


Ebay Store:
Our eBay store name is "theraggedrecord" which can be found with a quick search once logged in to eBay. You'll find numerous items for sale and at auction. Please take note: what you find for sale here is just a fraction of our total collection!

Ragged Records buys, sells, and trades. Come on in - our staff will be happy to help with all your music needs. You can always shoot us an email or send us a message through facebook too.

Thanks - I hope to see you soon.

- Bob Herington, Owner

### House of Guitars

645 Titus Ave
Rochester, NY

The House of Guitars®®,Inc. is a store selling guitars, percussion and related items in Irondequoit, a suburb of Rochester, New York. Billed as the "Largest  Guitar Store in the World," it has a prodigious collection of new, used and vintage guitars packed into a few thousand square feet of retail space. Guitars are housed in cases two levels deep with more displayed well above head height on the tops of the cases. Some seem to be for show purposes only, or to add to the atmosphere. Following a staircase an upstairs room sells drums and keyboards and also does repairs. Back rooms and a maze of twisty passages serve as retail space for percussion, amplification, PA's etc, with a large area at the rear, accessible from a rear parking lot, selling CD's and other audio at rock-bottom prices. This area is famously disorganized and may require much digging to unearth the music desired, often turning up unexpected gems. However, this disorganization is actually an illusion as every CD is cataloged in the store's computer system and most CD displays are organized alphabetically. The House of Guitars® also has full repair service on all musical instruments and amps. They offer music lessons on all musical instruments.

The store was founded and is still owned and run by the Schaubroeck brothers, Armand and Bruce, who keep themselves in the public eye with bizarre video commercials for the store as well as public appearances. Another brother, Blaine also works the store, as do local musicians who are given generous time off to tour with their bands.

The store claims many rock-and-roll personalities as current and former customers. A store shirt can be seen in the 1994 film, P.C.U.

### Freakbeat Records

13616 Ventura Blvd.
Sherman Oaks, CA 91423

Freakbeat Records is like a neighborhood record store from the days when shopping for music was fun and adventurous. We may not have everything you want, but we always have something you need.

Half the store is filled with new and used vinyl from all musical genres. Hundreds of collectible records line the walls and ceiling beams inside Freakbeat. The rock section is largest, but we're very aggressive about filling the jazz and soul bins too. We have a special section of ‘80's 12" singles with plenty of KROQ Flashback Favorites, plus 12" sections for dance music and for rap and hip-hop. Hundreds of 7" singles include lots of soul and rock titles.

Keep browsing through country, blues, folk, reggae, soundtracks, classical, and more. At Freakbeat you can listen to any used record or CD that is already open.

Our selection of compact discs highlights new releases and reissues that the big box stores generally ignore. We try to stock music that you might be looking for, rather than just what the record companies are trying to sell you. Freakbeat has lots of imports and small label reissues of the psychedelic, punk, jazz, and progressive past. We can special order anything for you that is still in print and get it to you quickly.

Freakbeat offers the discerning music lover an unusual and interesting variety of music DVDs. For movie fans, we have a large selection of used films on DVD and Blu-Ray.  We have books, magazines, vintage posters, and other unusual odds and ends waiting to be discovered.

Our 99 cent room is a mecca for bargain buyers from throughout Southern California - thousands of LPs and CDs priced at just 99 cents each, restocked every day. If you're interested in buying in bulk, we can wheel and deal all day long!

Freakbeat Records is easy to get to, comfortable to shop in, and within walking distance of many fine restaurants, coffee shops, and cafes.

### CD Central

377 S Limestone St, Lexington, KY 40508

CD Central is Lexington’s oldest and largest independent NEW and USED music store, specializing in indie rock, alternative, R&B, metal, country, jazz, blues, bluegrass, and musical alternatives of all kinds. CD Central has an extensive selection of new, used and collectible LPs and carries turntables and accessories to help you get the most out of your vinyl collection.  We also carry a good selection of new and used DVDs, posters, t-shirts, stereo equipment and much more.

We opened in 1995 near the University of Kentucky campus and were mainly a used CD store at that time.  In a couple of years we doubled our space, moved to a bigger location a block away in 1999 (our present building), and then doubled our space yet again a few years later.  While our big-box competition has reduced their music selection we’ve continued to grow!

CD Central is one of the founding members of the Alliance of Independent Media Stores (AIMS) as well as Lexington’s “buy local” organization, Local First Lexington.  On Record Store Day and certain other holidays we throw a big parking lot party with local bands, which has become something of a local tradition, and we’ve also hosted in-stores by nationally-known artists as varied as the Black Keys, Charlie Louvin, Bernie Worrell and the Avett Brothers.

### Book House In Dinkytown

Sometimes small and personal is the better experience. Chris, at the Book House in Dinkydale Mall, loves vinyl. While the store stocks over 60,000 used academic books, you can find vinyl records on the second floor. There is a small browser at the store and Chris thinks that “less is more in some ways.” He has been to Amoeba Record Store in Los Angeles and says, “I always walk out of there with nothing and I am completely drained from looking at too many records. I like looking through a smaller amount of records. I’d much rather browse through a smaller amount.” The majority of the LPs at Bookhouse are in very good condition. Chris will make house calls and does buy larger collections, turntables, older tube receivers and other high-end audio. He loves tracking down turntables for people.

### Exile on Main Street

100 N Chestnut St, Champaign, Illinois

Exile on Main St. opened its doors in 2004 and has been voted “Best Record Store” in Champaign-Urbana nearly every year since. The owner, Jeff Brandt, has only worked in record stores since the early ’90s, first learning the ropes at Periscope CDs and Tapes. In the fall of 2014, we moved to a new, larger space in the historic old train station building on Chestnut St., just a few blocks from our former downtown location in the One Main building on Main Street. The new location is much larger, so we can host more live events on our already famous “record stage” and we’ve expanded our inventory of LPs, CDs, tapes, and video games way beyond what we could cram in the old location. We also sell new and used turntables, which we are all too happy to help you with. Be sure to follow us on Facebook to see a teaser of each week’s new releases. If you don’t see what you want, let us know! We’re happy to special order what you want.

We are also proud to share this great new space with another of our favorite local businesses, Dandelion Vintage. For all your vintage needs, please be sure to check them out as well.

### Watts Music

1211 Grant Ave, Novato, CA, 94945

Since 1979, Watts Music has been one of the principal retailers of music, both old and new, in the North Bay.  While Watts sells music in a variety of formats, in recent years the record store has seen a surge in popularity due to their large selection of vinyl records; something they never stopped selling, even when vinyl was considered obsolete by many.  In addition to vinyl, Watts also has a wide array of cassettes, CD's, and even 8-tracks (for those with super vintage car stereos).

Perhaps Watts' greatest strength as a store is their extremely fair pricing.  Older titles that might be priced at $20 or more only 45 minutes away in San Francisco or the East Bay, are generally all between the $5 and $8 range at Watts.  This makes the store a particular favorite of collectors fortunate enough to live close by.

An additional benefit of Watts is, if they don't have the title you're looking for in-store, Darren, the manager, can generally order it from his distributor and have it at the store in as little as one or two business days.

For those looking for a truly old school record shop to browse and talk music in, Watts is definitely the place to go.

Situated right next door to Counterpoint is Harmony, our fine book and ephemera annex. Harmony showcases rare, collectible, and antiquarian books for serious collectors and curious browsers alike.

If you are looking to consolidate your own collection or liquidate an estate, we will be happy to look through your books, records or other items, and offer you cash or store credit for whatever we purchase. There is a buyer on premises every day, and we can also travel to your location for an evaluation of your collection after a phone or email consultation.

Bill Brueck opened his first shop in 1988 on the corner of Baymeadows and Old Kings road. With the help of Jean and Deanna Brueck, that store stayed in operation until 2001. With Ebay, selling records online was easy and safe, so Yesterday & Today Records turned into a online sales only business and the doors closed.

In 2010 William Brueck re-opened Yesterday & Today Records into a physical store location at the Beach Blvd. flea market. In 2017 a true brick and mortar storefront was opened. Yesterday & Today Records Lives Again.

A few short years later, he opened the first Exclusive Company location on Main Street in West Bend, WI. Still going strong 50 years later with 7 locations.

### Rhino Records

235 Yale Ave
Claremont, CA 91711

Rhino Records in Claremont, California, was opened in 1976 by the Rhino label (the reigning champs of repackaging, reissuing and recycling hits & misses from yesteryear) which sold off its retail operations in 1981 (we have been independently owned & operated since, so no hankies please). We used to be located in a tiny shack selling punk & love beads next to a Bric-A-Brac Outlet and an "Aura Cleansing" parlor. In 1990, we moved into a 6000 square foot box located on the corners of Yale & Bonita and have gathered no moss since.

We are a record store like they used to be in the good ole days; a plethora of obscure (from our weighty progressive rock & electronic sections) carved next to our rock, classical, and whathaveyou. Thousands of new & used LP's are located next to the Rhino stage which has been graced by Yo La Tengo, Eagles of Death Metal, Kimya Dawson, Jimmy Eat World, The Mountain Goats & a wealth of others. We also carry a large selection of out of this world toys, stickers & other off the beaten path chotchkes.

Claremont is a good 40 minute drive east of Los Angeles and our store is located in the "Claremont Village." Located a stones throw away from the 5 prominent Claremont Colleges, the village is an amalgamation of the clashing local colors, from a coffee house down the street where Jewel & Beck used to play, to the folk music center (owned by Ben Harper), where musical instruments & field recordings are sold.

Tune into 88.7 KSPC on your drive into town and hear the latest in the world of underground sounds on your way to the local skatepark! Don't forget that Rhino is air condintioned, UV Free and Wooly on top!

Everything is used. The Wax Museum is a one room free standing building that promotes itself as having "beach music." They actually have beach, rock, country, big band, doo wop and jazz. They have a huge collection of 45s that are pretty much categorized by artist. The 45s begin in the 1950s and carry through to the present. The majority seem to be in the 50's, 60s and 70s. There are records everywhere including under the bins and even a few stacks laying flat. It would take a week to look through every 45.

### Vintage Vinyl

925 Davis St. - Evanston, IL - 60201 USA

Also featured in the book: The Time Traveler’s Wife by Audrey Niffenegger!
 
“When my friends and I wanted something like the June Brides, or, say, the Icicle Works' Love Is a Wonderful Colour picture disc, we had to ride our bicycles 22 miles, to Evanston, the closest college town, where stood Vintage Vinyl, then and now one of the great record stores of the world. The place wasn't big, but they had a great import section, and they kept their records in thick plastic sleeves, which appealed to us, because we were geek-serious about all this. So serious that we brought backpacks lined in sturdy cardboard, so we could ride the purchases safely back home, without dents or bendings to the records' corners. So serious that we kept our records wrapped doubly in plastic sleeves, and we cleaned the grooves, with the softest chamois, after each play.” –Dave Eggers in the UK’s Guardian Unlimited

He would play that record on anyone's turntable that would listen. By the mid sixties, two new discoveries were made; The Beatles and Garage Sales. Since then, the collection has mushroomed into the mass collection available at Shake Rag Music today.

The mix changes regularly so that we can supply our customers with what they want and need. But the emphasis is always on our customers. We believe in giving the maximum value for every dollar you spend. It is our philosophy that if we offer great deals, people will keep coming back. It's been working well so far. Our philosophy on life is not dissimilar. Treat people as you would like to be treated and it will return to you many times.

### Vintage Vinyl

6610 Delmar
St. Louis MO 63130

Tom Ray and Lew Prince loved music, but thought most record stores sucked. In 1979, they decided to start a record store for music lovers. It would be a record store built from the customers’ point of view. It would be a place where you’d find good music of all types and people working there who could tell you about it.

But they didn’t have any money to rent a store (bummer), so they pooled about three hundred records they’d gathered and rented a booth at the Soulard Farmer’s Market in St. Louis, MO. They sold most of the records and bought more for the next week. Pretty soon they were hauling a couple of thousand records to the Farmer’s Market every Saturday. That was the fall of 1979.

They finally rented a 400 sq, ft. store at 6354 Delmar. They got it cheap because it had 136 building code violations. They only sold used records (CD’s weren’t even invented yet!). Business was good. The store was open about 90 hours a week. Tom and Lew got tired, so they hired their first employee. Soon there were more.

Customers said, “How come you guys don’t stock new records? There’s lots of stuff we can’t find at those other stores.”

So they did. Business got even better. Pretty soon they moved to 6362 Delmar. This was a much better store. It only had 129 building code violations. Now their store was almost a thousand sq. ft. It sounds like a lot but Tom and Lew just couldn’t stop buying records. It got really cramped in there really quickly.

Sometimes they’d run out of money and Tom would say, “Music will get you through times of no money better than money will get you through times of no music.” So they’d buy more records. After CD’s were invented they started buying and selling those too. Now the store was really full.

So they moved up the street to where they are now. “Wow, 7000 sq. ft. We’ll never run out of room again!”, said Lew. The new store was open lot’s more hours. Tom and Lew hired lots of employees. They all started buying records and CD’s.

How’s that for progress?

### Groovers

215 W Big Springs Rd
Riverside, CA 92507

History: 
Established in 2011, Groovers is a new music store located in Riverside, Ca. (1 block East of UCR campus). I have had a 30 plus year career in the construction industry but my passion has always been music (especially vinyl LP's). I spent many years at Gillette's Records in the Brockton Arcade here in Riverside learning from the master himself. Being a 40 yr. plus vinyl collector I always knew "my turn" would come. With the recent resurgence of vinyl and the lack of construction work the timing was right for a change so here I am.
 
Meet the Business Owner: Tom A
Native "Riversidian" . Lived throughout So. Cal. after high school and settled back here in Riverside in 1998'. Spent 30 yrs. in Construction as a career but stepped to the side lines in 09'. Catching up on what I missed and living a dream.

History

Established in 1995.

Head Line Records store started in Sept 1995 by Jean Luc Gaudry (the French guy!!). The first location was in the corner of Westwood Blvd & Pico Blvd in Los Angeles, CA. A year later, the store moved right down the street, on Westwood Blvd. After 3 years, the store moved to Melrose ave, behind Brooklyn Project store. 4 months later, we found a big location. We were sharing the spot with my good friend Dave Naze (owner of Chaser Merchandising). After a few year, Chaser moved to a bigger location, and we had to move to a smaller location: just next door, where we are right now.
Prior, I organized some shows in France under the name "Headline Presents" and I was a DJ for many years.

### Moondog Records

4440 S Maryland Pkwy, Las Vegas, NV 89119

When you walk into MoonDog Records you'll be greeted by
Clint McKean, the owner of MoonDog records, who is unmistakable by the ever growing rock beard that he sports. 

And if you like to talk music, and especially vinyl records of course, Mckean will share his love of music with you.  You'll learn that the vast collection that sprawls the length of the walls, and continues to grow, started out as his personal collection that he really only started collecting in 2009.  Since then, McKean's collection has grown from a few hundred albums to the double-digit thousands along with turntables, CD's, cassettes, collectible memorabilia, boom-boxes (which he is extremely proud of), band shirts, guitars, amps, and even the informative music book.  This man lives for the music.

When he's not at the store, which is rare, the urge for vinyl never leaves him and he is probably out scouring Vegas and other areas looking for replenishment vinyl and other goodies for the store.

McKean's love for the vinyl record, which he considers to almost be art over the still popular CD and always growing popularity of the digital download, made him want to share his passion with people and provide them with a music format that isn't just tangible but has a history and a retaining value.

### Strictly Discs

1900 Monroe St, Madison, WI 53711

Sometime after the decline of the phonographic record and before the inevitable conclusion in which mankind will be fitted with a wireless connection attached to the frontline, the compact disc became the favored medium for the music-buying public. 

Strictly Discs was launched in 1988, just in time for all the baby boomers making the jump from analog to digital. The first all-CD store in Madison, Strictly Discs made a choice to carry new, used and collectible compact discs. By the time the store moved into a location tucked between the UW-Madison and Edgewood campuses, it had solidified a reputation as one of the midwests best independent music retailers. 

By the time the 21st Century rolled around, the store added new and used vinyl to its offerings, a retro move that anticipated the return of a sizeable record-buying audience. Throughout its history, Strictly Discs has displayed a knack for coming through with unsurpassed customer service, particularly in its ability to fulfill special order requests in under 24 hours. Blessed with a savvy staff whose knowledge may only be surpassed by their cumulative experience, insightful recommendations, along with seven custom listening stations displaying 500 recent releases for perusal, help ensure a satisfied clientele that has us going strong 20 years in the game.

### The Bizarre Bazaar

254 Linden St, Fort Collins, CO, USA

"Located in the historic Old Town district of Fort Collins, the Bizarre Bazaar buys, sells and trades used books, music, videos and other printed items. So instead of stockpiling your books, music and videos for "someday", sell them or trade them for stuff you haven't enjoyed yet. We also offer a relaxing atmosphere where you can meet others interested in pre-download era media.
 
Our "browser's paradise" philosophy focuses on keeping a rich in-house selection, a selection the local community helps us create by buying, selling, and trading with us.  In addition, our inventory is available only in our store and not online, and this has two benefits for our customers: It keeps the rare "gems" in our store for your browsing pleasure, and it forces us to lower our prices for a smaller (local) buying population. With a focus on your browsing experience the Bizarre Bazaar is the ideal place to discover books, music and videos you never knew existed."

### Brass City Records & Old Tools

489 Meadow St. Waterbury CT 06702

I've been selling music for thirty one  years right here in the shop and 10 years before that at record shows up & down the east coast and Europe.... We have loads of vinyl and inexpensive cds. While the sixties are my specialty, we have quite a lot of punk, metal, new wave, jazz, fifties, folk and R n' B. There's a big bin of $1 records in the back room...and a large bin of FREE records as well...while we're on the subject of prices: Throw away your price guides because I don't use 'em. I think they're highly over rated and way over priced. I don't want to have a museum here and everything is  priced to sell. Some of my customers actually have made a comfortable living selling stuff on ebay that they bought here...that's all part of the circle and more power to them...they come back and buy more...everybody's happy...I've got listening stations set up for vinyl and cds so you're not buying a "pig in a poke". You buy these to listen to...not to look at; so I guarantee each and every item I put out. Sorry no "flavor of the week" stuff here; we're not a maul store and don't want to be..

This is the largest indie store in the state and it does take quite a bit of time to see everything there is to see. I really should re-locate to New York City or Boston, the stock is that good! But, here I am in Waterbury the back ass end of the universe.... So it goes...

I do buy large collections of vinyl...give me a call or drop me a line...

The Brass City Tool  Shop

 I sell records for a living but I have a passion for woodworking and old tools. I really enjoy sharing both with anyone who will listen, and sometimes even people who will not listen. I own the only record store I know of with a functioning, though small, woodworking bench. I offer some fine wood working tools, most over 75 years old, and some well over 100 years old. They all still do what they were intended to do. Most were made right here in Connecticut within a stones throw of where I sit. The tools that I sell are tools that I would be proud to have in my own shop, or that I do have in my collection.

 
I clean for use . Blades will be sharp and ready to use, but it's up to you to put the final touches on the bevel. Soles will be flat for use but not polished . Please send your requests for tools and parts. I've got so many I couldn't possibly list them all. I guarantee all the tools I sell 100%...money back guarantee, just like the old days. Payment by cash, check, money order, charge card or paypal.

I only buy tools that I would be proud to own. I look for good "bones" ie: solid castings, good wood, and functioning mechanicals. 

I also buy old woodworking tools, particularly pattern makers and jointer's tool chests. If you have had a family member who worked in this trade please contact me. I personally collect scraper planes and spokeshaves. 

Walt Q...brass@snet.net 203-574-7805 if you call, please give me a few moments to get to a phone...this place is pretty big...


Any and all galoots are always welcome at the shop...drop by and try out some of the tools. ..if you're traveling through Connecticut; I'm 2 blocks off I-84 exit 21 or route 8 exit 32. Call or e-mail for directions or slap the address into mapquest.

### Bump 'n Grind

1200 East West Highway, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910

Coffee and vinyl records. These are two of our favorite things. They each bring joy to our senses; taste, smell, auditory. Each has also seen technology deliver these pleasures to a faster, consumer driven world, whether it be a cup of coffee, our favorite espresso drink, or the sound of music. We believe that much like a record spinning on a platter and the slow drip of a pour over, coffee and music are both best enjoyed in their most analog forms. So we decided to combine the two and bring the South Silver Spring Community a coffee shop with a love and passion for great coffee, espresso, and vinyl records. Hand poured individual coffees from around the world are offered and rotate as harvesting seasons come and go. We've worked with Vigilante Coffee to create our own, signature espresso blend which can be found only at Bump'nGrind. We have highly curated and small selections of new release vinyl with a focus on dance music, jazz, funk, soul, dub, rock, hiphop, and everything in between. Two listening stations allow customers to get lost in music and refine their selections prior to purchase. We hope you will enjoy our laid back atmosphere and relax to free wireless internet and a community turntable stocked with a crate of records for every customer to dig into and find gems to play over the shop's sound system or personal headphones. Come see why, sometimes, the best things are enjoyed at a slower pace.
