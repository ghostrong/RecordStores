# Record Stores in Vietnam

### Quang’s Records

2nd Floor, 131 Bui Thi Xuan, Hai Ba Trung
Hanoi

"Finding vinyl in Hanoi isn’t easy by any stretch. While there are vast collections here and there the owners keep themselves obscured, as making a profit isn’t their sole prerogative. Thankfully Quang’s Records makes itself more accessible. Opened in 2007 Quang’s is the first dedicated record shop in Vietnam. There’s a heavy bent towards jazz and the vinyl may not come as cheap as you think it will with the business being only a small venture." (http://www.tonedeaf.com.au/345511/hanoi-vietnam.htm)
